"""Per-model capability descriptor for the visualization toolkit.

Views read a uniform analysis surface (``topic_word``, ``doc_topic``,
``vocabulary``, ``num_topics``, optional ``labels`` / ``topic_names``), but the
*statistics and encodings* they apply switch on this small descriptor, mirroring
``topica.effects.model_family``. This is what keeps the toolkit honest: a c-TF-IDF
``topic_word`` is not a probability, a cluster model's ``doc_topic`` is degenerate,
and an effect-plot CI must be refused where there is no posterior to draw it from.
