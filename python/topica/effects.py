"""Prevalence analysis over a model's document-topic proportions ``theta``.

These tools work on the ``theta`` of any topica model:

- :func:`estimate_effect` regresses each topic's prevalence on document
  covariates (OLS, or the method of composition when given posterior draws).
- :func:`by_strata` reports mean prevalence within each level of a covariate.
- :func:`top_topics` lists each document's most prevalent topics.

Uncertainty propagation needs *draws* of ``theta``. STM and CTM have a
logistic-normal posterior, so :func:`posterior_theta_samples` draws from it. A
Gibbs model (LDA, keyATM, SeededLDA, ...) has no such posterior, so
:func:`dirichlet_theta_samples` draws ``theta`` from each document's Dirichlet
conditional given its proportions and length.

    Splits the documents by ``groups`` (one label per document) and, within each

    group we average theta over the documents in that group, giving a

    model
        A fitted model with a posterior over theta (any Dirichlet or

    groups
        One label per document; documents are pooled within each distinct value.
    ci
        Credible-interval coverage (default 0.95 gives a 95 percent band).
    normalize
        When ``True`` (default), each per-draw per-group prevalence row is rescaled
        to sum to 1 before the summary statistics, so it reads as a topic share.
    corpus
        The ``Corpus`` (or token lists) the model was fit on. Needed only when the
        model has no retained ``theta_draws`` and the Dirichlet fallback must
        recover document lengths.
    nsims
        Number of posterior draws. ``None`` (default) uses all retained MCMC draws
        as they are; an integer resamples to that many via :func:`composition_theta`.
    seed
        Seed for the draw sampler (used only on the resample / fallback paths).
    labels
        Optional explicit ordering of the group labels (matched to ``groups`` by
        string form). When omitted, groups are sorted by their string form.

    Returns
    -------

    ----------
    model : a fitted topica model.
    corpus : the ``Corpus`` (or token lists) the model was fit on. Required for
        ``method="composition"`` on a Gibbs model (for document lengths) and for
        ``method="bootstrap"`` (to resample documents).
    of : ``"effect"`` (covariate effects, needs ``formula``/``data`` or ``X``),
        ``"prevalence"`` (each topic's mean proportion), or ``"top_words"``
        (per-topic top-word stability; ``method="bootstrap"`` only).
    method : ``"composition"`` (default) draws theta from the model's posterior and
        pools by Rubin's rules — cheap, no refit, honest for effects/prevalence on

        aligns topics across refits — the only route for ``of="top_words"`` and for
        the embedding models, but it flags topics whose alignment is unstable.
    nsims : composition theta draws. n_boot : bootstrap resamples.
    min_alignment : a bootstrap topic whose mean top-word Jaccard with the
        reference falls below this is flagged ``reliable=False`` and its SE is
        suppressed (set to NaN), since a split/merge corrupts the estimate.
    min_margin : a topic is also flagged unreliable when its match is *ambiguous*
        — the best-matching refit topic is less than ``min_margin`` better (in
        Jaccard) than the next-best. This catches the case a high Jaccard misses:
        topics whose top words are not distinct, so the alignment is arbitrary.

    """Permutation test for a binary prevalence covariate (R ``stm``'s ``permutationTest``).

    Assesses whether a binary document-level covariate genuinely shifts topic
    prevalence, or whether an apparent association could arise by chance. Each
    permutation randomly reassigns the covariate at its empirical rate, refits
    the model from fresh starting values (passing the permuted covariate to the
    model for covariate-aware families), aligns the refit topics to the
    reference (using the Hungarian top-word matcher from
    :func:`~topica.validation._hungarian`), and records the covariate's effect
    on every topic. The observed effect for each topic is then compared to the
    permutation null to compute a two-sided p-value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a fitted topica model.
        The reference fit. Its type is used to build each permutation refit
        (``type(model)(num_topics=K, seed=s)``), unless ``model_factory`` is
        given. The model must expose ``doc_topic``, ``topic_word``, and
        ``vocabulary``.
    corpus : list of token lists or a ``Corpus``.
        The documents the model was fit on. Each permutation refits on the
        same documents with a shuffled covariate.
    covariate : array-like (num_docs,), binary (0/1 or True/False).
        The binary prevalence covariate to test. Must have exactly two unique
        values; they are mapped to 0 and 1 in sorted order.
    n_perm : int
        Number of permutation refits. Higher values give more stable p-values;
        100 is enough for a screening test, 500 for publication.
    topics : sequence of int, optional
        Restrict the output to these topic indices. Defaults to all topics.
    topn : int
        Top-word count used for topic alignment across refits.
    seed : int
        Master RNG seed. Permutation seeds are derived as ``seed + perm_index``.
    model_factory : callable(seed) -> unfitted model, optional
        Override the default ``type(model)(num_topics=K, seed=s)`` builder. Use
        this when the model's constructor needs extra arguments (e.g. keyword
        lists for KeyATM, or content covariates for STM).
    iters : int, optional
        Iterations for each permutation refit. When ``None`` the refit's default
        iteration count is used. Pass a smaller value (e.g. ``iters=100``) to
        speed up screening tests.

    Returns
    -------
    list of :class:`PermutationResult`
        One entry per topic (restricted to ``topics`` when given), each with
        the observed effect, the permutation null distribution, and a two-sided
        p-value.

    Notes
    -----
    For covariate-aware models (STM, DMR, KeyATM) the permuted covariate is
    passed directly to each refit so the null model is correctly specified
    (matching R ``stm``'s ``permutationTest`` behaviour). For covariate-free
    models (LDA, HDP, etc.) permuting the labels used only in the effect
    statistic remains a valid null.

    The p-value uses the ``(1 + count) / (1 + n_perm)`` convention, so it is
    never exactly zero. Permutation statistics that are NaN (from unmatched
    topics in variable-K refits such as HDP) are dropped from the null before
    computing the p-value; the effective n is reduced accordingly.
