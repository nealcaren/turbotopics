"""Corpus-comparison keyword metrics — which words distinguish two groups.

Unlike :class:`~topica.SAGE` and the model-based ``word_contrast``, these
operate directly on two raw token corpora with no fitted model. The headline is
the **Fighting Words** estimator (Monroe, Colaresi & Quinn 2008, *Fightin'
Words*, *Political Analysis*): a log-odds-ratio with an informative Dirichlet
prior that accounts for how a word's sampling variance shrinks with frequency,
so rare words don't dominate the way they do with raw log-ratios.

    from corpus B, with their statistical significance.

    For each word the weighted log-odds-ratio with an informative Dirichlet prior
    is computed and standardized to a z-score ``ζ``:

    ``δ_w = log[(y_Aw+α_w)/(n_A+α₀-y_Aw-α_w)] - log[(y_Bw+α_w)/(n_B+α₀-y_Bw-α_w)]``,
    ``Var(δ_w) ≈ 1/(y_Aw+α_w) + 1/(y_Bw+α_w)``, ``ζ_w = δ_w / √Var(δ_w)``,

    where ``y_·w`` are word counts, ``n_·`` are corpus token totals, and ``α₀ =
    Σ_w α_w``. A large **positive** ``ζ`` marks a word distinctive of corpus A; a
    large negative ``ζ`` marks one distinctive of corpus B. Because the variance
    term grows for rare words, ``|ζ| > 1.96`` is a defensible ~95% cutoff.

    Parameters
    ----------
    corpus_a, corpus_b : sequence of token lists (``list[list[str]]``).
    prior : float, default 0.01
        The Dirichlet pseudocount. With ``informative=False`` it is a symmetric
        prior ``α_w = prior`` for every word. With ``informative=True`` the prior
        is scaled by each word's overall frequency, ``α_w = prior · c_w`` where
        ``c_w`` is the word's combined count — Monroe et al.'s informative
        Dirichlet prior (IDP), which pulls extreme estimates toward the corpus
        background.
    min_count : int, default 1
        Drop words whose combined count across both corpora is below this.

    Returns
    -------
    list[(word, zeta)] sorted by descending ``zeta`` — corpus-A markers at the
    top, corpus-B markers at the bottom.
