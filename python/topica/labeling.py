"""LLM topic labeling, as plumbing.

topica assembles the labeling prompt from each topic's top words and
representative documents; you bring the model. The core is dependency-free and
takes any callable ``str -> str`` (:func:`llm_topic_labels` with ``call=``), so
your own client, an ``ollama`` endpoint, or an API wrapper all work without
topica taking a dependency. :func:`llm_backend` is an optional adapter for Simon
Willison's `llm <https://llm.datasette.io/>`_ library, so you can name a model
instead of writing the call yourself — one optional dependency that reaches every
provider and local models via plugins.

LLM labels are a readable convenience, not a reproducible measurement. Pin the
model and set temperature to 0 for stability, and keep FREX / probability / lift
(:func:`topica.label_topics`) as the defensible, deterministic descriptors.
