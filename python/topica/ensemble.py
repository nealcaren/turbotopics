"""Ensemble topic modeling: combine several independent fits into one consensus.

A single topic-model fit is a draw from a noisy procedure — change the seed or a
hyperparameter and the topics shift, sometimes a lot (Hoyle et al. 2022, "Are
Neural Topic Models Broken?"). Combining several independent runs is more reliable
than any one run: across Hoyle et al.'s experiments the ensemble improves on the
median run in 97% of contexts and never loses to the worst. This module builds
that consensus.

It is the natural follow-on to :func:`~topica.select_model`, which fits N runs at a
fixed K. Instead of *picking* the best run with ``plot_models``, ``ensemble``
*combines* all of them.

Three methods are available:

``method="cluster"`` (default) reproduces Hoyle et al. §6. Pool the topics from
every run (m runs of K topics each give m·K topics), measure the pairwise distance
between them — a blend ``lambda_·D(topic-word) + (1-lambda_)·D(doc-topic)`` using a
top-weighted rank distance (Rank-Biased Overlap, or average Jaccard) — cluster the
pooled topics into K groups, and take the element-wise mean within each cluster.
Clustering does not force a one-to-one match, so a topic that splits or merges
across runs is handled naturally, and a cluster only a few runs contributed to is
flagged as low-support.

``method="align"`` is a lighter, fully deterministic alternative (the Miller &
McCoy 2017 / Mäntylä et al. 2018 lineage): align every run's topics one-to-one to
a single reference run (Hungarian matching on the topic-word distributions) and
average the aligned topics. No clustering, no Θ, no λ.

``method="stable"`` reimplements gensim's ``EnsembleLda`` (Brigl 2019). It does not
fix K: it pools the topics, measures an asymmetric masked-cosine distance between
them, runs Checkback DBSCAN (CBDBSCAN) to find dense, reproducible "cores", and
keeps only the clusters with enough cores as *stable topics* (averaging their
members). Unstable topics — those that do not recur densely across runs — are
discarded as noise rather than averaged in, so the number of consensus topics is
discovered from the data. Validated against gensim in ``parity/``.

The result duck-types as a fitted model for the model-neutral analysis surface (it
exposes ``topic_word``, ``doc_topic``, and ``vocabulary``), so the consensus flows
straight into :func:`~topica.coherence`, the diagnostics, and the rest. Each
ensemble topic carries a ``stability`` score and a ``reliable`` flag, so a
consensus topic the individual runs do not actually agree on is marked, not
silently trusted.

    Exposes ``topic_word``, ``doc_topic``, and ``vocabulary`` so it can be passed

    Attributes
    ----------
    topic_word : ``(K, V)`` averaged, row-normalized topic-word matrix.
    doc_topic : ``(D, K)`` averaged document-topic matrix, or ``None`` when the
        runs were not fit on the same documents in the same order.
    vocabulary : the shared vocabulary, or ``None`` when raw arrays were passed.
    stability : ``(K,)`` per-topic consistency in ``[0, 1]``. For ``"cluster"`` and
        ``"stable"`` it is one minus the mean pairwise distance among the run
        topics that formed the cluster; for ``"align"`` it is the mean top-word
        Jaccard with the matched run topics. 1.0 means every run produced the same
        topic.
    support : ``(K,)`` how well-backed each topic is. For ``"cluster"`` and
        ``"stable"`` it is the fraction of runs that contributed a topic to the
        cluster (1.0 = all runs found it); for ``"align"`` it is the match margin
        over the next-best run topic. A small value means few runs really support
        the topic.
    reliable : ``(K,)`` bool — ``stability >= 0.5`` *and* well-supported. An
        unreliable topic is a consensus the individual runs do not agree on; treat
        it with suspicion. (``"stable"`` topics are reproducible by construction,
        so this is usually all ``True``.)
    agreement : scalar mean of ``stability`` — an overall "how reproducible is this
        K?" number (``nan`` if ``"stable"`` found no topics).
    method : ``"cluster"``, ``"align"``, or ``"stable"``.
    cluster_sizes : ``(K,)`` number of run topics in each cluster (``"cluster"``
        and ``"stable"``; ``None`` for ``"align"``).
    reference : index of the reference run (``"align"`` only; ``None`` for
        ``"cluster"``).
    n_runs : number of fits combined.
    runs : the input fits, in the order given.

    """Combine several topic-model fits into one consensus model.

    The consensus is more reliable than any single run — it beats the median run
    and rarely loses to the best (Hoyle et al. 2022). This is the natural
    follow-on to :func:`~topica.select_model`: fit N runs, then combine them here
    instead of picking one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    runs : a list of fitted models (or ``(K, V)`` topic-word arrays sharing a
        vocabulary), or a :class:`~topica.validation.SelectModelResult`. All runs
        must share the same K and vocabulary.
    method : ``"cluster"`` (default) reproduces Hoyle et al. §6 — pool the topics
        from all runs, cluster them, and average within each cluster. ``"align"``
        matches every run's topics to one reference run and averages the aligned
        topics (simpler, deterministic, no document-topic distance).
    num_topics : number of consensus topics for ``"cluster"`` (default: the runs'
        K). Ignored by ``"align"`` (which always returns K).
    lambda_ : ``"cluster"`` only — weight on the topic-word distance when pooling
        topics; ``1 - lambda_`` weights the document-topic distance. Falls back to
        ``1.0`` when the runs were not fit on the same documents.
    distance : ``"cluster"`` only — the top-weighted rank distance between topics:
        ``"rbo"`` (Rank-Biased Overlap, default) or ``"jaccard"`` (average Jaccard).
    topn : top-word (and top-document) count for the distances and diagnostics.
    reference : ``"align"`` only — which run anchors the matching. ``"medoid"``
        (default) picks the run that aligns most cheaply to all others; ``"first"``
        uses run 0; an int uses that run.
    metric : ``"align"`` only — topic-word distance for the matching, ``"cosine"``
        (default) or ``"js"``.
    weights : optional per-run weights (length ``n_runs``) for a weighted average —
        e.g. down-weight low-coherence runs. ``None`` (default) weights equally.
        Used by ``"cluster"`` and ``"align"``.
    eps, min_samples, min_cores, masking, masking_threshold : ``"stable"`` only —
        the gensim ``EnsembleLda`` knobs. ``eps`` (default 0.1) is the CBDBSCAN
        neighbor radius; ``min_samples`` (default ``int(n_runs/2)``) the neighbors
        needed to be a core; ``min_cores`` (default ``min(3, n_runs//4 + 1)``) the
        cores a cluster needs to count as a stable topic; ``masking`` is ``"mass"``
        (default) or ``"rank"`` and ``masking_threshold`` its cutoff (gensim
        defaults 0.95 / 0.11). A larger ``eps`` or smaller ``min_cores`` yields more
        (looser) stable topics.

    Returns
    -------
    An :class:`EnsembleResult`. It exposes ``topic_word``, ``doc_topic``, and
    ``vocabulary``, so it passes straight into :func:`~topica.coherence`, the
    diagnostics, and other model-neutral analyses. Per-topic ``stability`` and
    ``reliable`` flags mark consensus topics the individual runs do not agree on.
