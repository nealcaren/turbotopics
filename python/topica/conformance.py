"""Estimator conformance: registry, contract definition, and check helper.

Every topica estimator must expose a uniform interface organized into three tiers.
This module encodes that contract, the principled exemptions from it, and the
known gaps (fixable drift tracked as a burn-down worklist). It also provides
``check_conformance(model_or_class) -> list[str]``, which callers and the
conformance test use to verify a model against its required tier.

The three tiers
---------------
Tier 0  (floor, every estimator):
    ``fit(data, ...)`` — with the canonical iteration kwarg ``iters`` where the
    model is iterative.
    Properties/methods: ``topic_word``, ``doc_topic``, ``vocabulary``,
    ``num_topics``, ``topic_names``, ``doc_names``, ``top_words``,
    ``coherence``, ``save``, ``load``.

Tier 1  (generative models, i.e. ``model_family != "none"``):
    ``transform(docs) -> (n, num_topics)``.

Tier 2  (family-specific):
    ``model_family == "dirichlet"``  ->  ``alpha``, ``theta_draws``,
    ``doc_lengths``.
    ``model_family == "logistic_normal"``  ->  ``eta_mean``, ``eta_cov``.

Exemptions
----------
Some requirements are principled exemptions that will never be closed, because
the model's statistics differ structurally from the requirement. These are
recorded in :data:`EXEMPT` as ``(model_name, requirement) -> reason``.

Known gaps
----------
:data:`KNOWN_GAPS` records temporary non-conformance:
``(model_name, requirement) -> phase_note``. The conformance test treats these
as expected failures so the suite is green today while this map is the
burn-down worklist. The program ends when ``KNOWN_GAPS == {}``.
