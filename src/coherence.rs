//! Fast co-occurrence statistics for topic-coherence scoring.
//!
//! Coherence measures (UMass, UCI, NPMI, C_v) all reduce to two quantities over
//! a reference corpus: how many "windows" each top word appears in, and how many
//! windows each *pair* of top words co-occurs in. The naive approach slides a
//! window one token at a time and, at every position, enumerates all present
//! relevant words and bumps every present pair — `O(n_windows · present²)` work,
//! which is brutal for long documents, wide windows (C_v uses 110), and large K
//! (every topic's top-N words become "relevant").
//!
//! Two observations make this cheap:
//!
//! 1. **Only the pairs that occur within some topic's top-N are ever scored** —
//!    roughly `K · C(topn, 2)` pairs, not the full `R²` matrix.
//! 2. **A word's window membership is an interval union.** A token at position
//!    `p` belongs to every window whose start lies in `[p-w+1, p]`. So for one
//!    word, the set of windows it appears in is the union of those per-position
//!    start-intervals; for a pair, the co-occurring windows are the intersection
//!    of the two unions. Both are computed from the words' sorted position lists
//!    in linear time — no per-window enumeration at all.
//!
//! `window == 0` collapses each document to a single whole-document window,
//! which yields exactly the document-level co-occurrence UMass wants.
