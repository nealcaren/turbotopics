"""Reproduce the STM (Structural Topic Model) R-package vignette with topica.

Works through the same analysis as Roberts, Stewart & Tingley's `stm` vignette,
on the same data (`gadarian`: 341 open-ended survey responses about immigration,
with an experimental `treatment` and party-id `pid_rep`), using topica
instead of R. Maps each vignette step to its topica equivalent:

    textProcessor / prepDocuments  ->  tokenize + stopwords + frequency pruning
    stm(prevalence = ~treatment)   ->  STM(K).fit(docs, prevalence=X)
    labelTopics                    ->  stm.label_topics  (prob / FREX)
    estimateEffect(~treatment)     ->  stm.estimate_effect(model.doc_topic, X)
    topicCorr                      ->  STM.topic_correlation
    findThoughts                   ->  stm.find_thoughts

Data: gadarian, from the stm R package (GPL-3); Gadarian & Albertson (2014).

Run:  python examples/stm_vignette.py
