"""Topics in W.E.B. Du Bois's *Crisis* writing — an end-to-end topica tour.

This tutorial works the topica topic-modeling library through a real
corpus: 704 articles from *The Crisis*, the NAACP magazine Du Bois edited from
its founding in 1910 until he left in 1934. The articles span 1910-1934 (the
great bulk are Du Bois's own editorials), so the corpus lets us ask not only
*what* Du Bois wrote about but *how those topics shifted across his editorship*
— from the agitation and WWI of the 1910s, through the New Negro / Harlem
Renaissance 1920s, into the economic-program early 1930s.

The data file `examples/dubois_crisis.csv` is produced by the corpus builder
that ships alongside this script; columns are
``title,year,decade,volume,issue,author,subjects,text``.

We move through topica's models in the order you would in real research:

    1. Preprocess  : tokenize + stoplist, build a pruned ``Corpus``.
    2. Phrases     : learn collocations ("jim crow", "colored people") first.
    3. LDA         : a plain topic model, scored with coherence + diversity.
    4. STM         : prevalence on decade — which topics rise/fall over time.
    5. DTM         : dynamic topics — trace a word's trajectory across decades.
    6. HDP         : let the model infer how many topics there are.
    7. Guided      : seed named topics with KeyATM when you know the themes.
    8. Utilities   : summary(), save/load, prepare_pyldavis().

Everything here is tuned to run in a couple of minutes. Where a knob trades
speed for quality (K, iterations, EM sweeps) we use a modest value and note in
a comment how to scale it up for a real analysis.

    #    document metadata. We make prevalence a function of DECADE (one-hot
    #    dummies via topica.one_hot), so the model can express that, say,
    #    a "Harlem Renaissance" topic is more common in the 1920s.
    #
    #    To ask "which topics rose or fell over time" with proper uncertainty,
    #    we use the method of composition (Treier & Jackman 2008), exactly as
    #    the R `stm` package does:
    #      posterior_theta_samples -> draws of the doc-topic matrix theta
    #      estimate_effect(draws, X=year) -> regress each topic on year,
    #          pooling the draws by Rubin's rules so the SEs include
    #          topic-estimation uncertainty.
    #    A positive, significant `year` slope = the topic grew over time.

    #    through time within the topic where it lives — Du Bois's vocabulary
    #    of "war", "labor", "africa" waxes and wanes across his editorship.
    #
    #    chain_variance controls how freely a topic may drift between slices.
    #    The default (0.005) is deliberately stiff and barely moves on a
    #    3-slice corpus; 0.05 lets real trends show while staying smooth.
