# 4. Measure effects properly

Most social-science topic-model papers don't stop at "here are the themes."
They ask **how topic prevalence relates to something**: time, group, treatment,
ideology. Doing this credibly means modeling the relationship *and* reporting
honest uncertainty.

## Make prevalence depend on covariates: STM

The Structural Topic Model lets a document's topic proportions depend on its
metadata. Fit prevalence as a regression on your covariates:

```python
import topica

X, names = topica.one_hot(party)                     # or build any design matrix
model = topica.STM(num_topics=20, seed=1)
model.fit(docs, prevalence=X, prevalence_names=names)
```

## Estimate effects with honest uncertainty

A naive regression of point topic proportions on covariates treats θ as if it
were observed exactly. It isn't. R's `stm` uses the **method of composition**
(Treier & Jackman 2008): draw θ from the model's posterior, regress each draw,
and pool by Rubin's rules so the standard errors include topic-estimation
uncertainty. topica does the same:

```python
from topica import stm

draws = stm.posterior_theta_samples(model, nsims=50, seed=0)   # (50, D, K)
effects = stm.estimate_effect(draws, X, feature_names=names)
for e in effects:
    d = e.as_dict()
    print(f"Topic {d['topic']}: {names[0]} coef={d[names[0]]['coef']:+.4f} "
          f"z={d[names[0]]['z']:+.2f}")
```

For non-linear time trends and interactions, build the design matrix with
`stm.spline` and `stm.interaction`, the same `~ s(year)` and `~ a*b` you'd write
in R.

## Cluster your standard errors

Text data is almost always **nested**: multiple speeches by the same legislator,
many tweets per user, several articles per outlet, or, if you
[split long documents](corpus.md), many chunks per source document. Ignoring this
nesting understates uncertainty and is a common reason reviewers reject a result.

Pass a `cluster` variable and the standard errors become cluster-robust (CR1):

```python
effects = stm.estimate_effect(
    draws, X, feature_names=names,
    cluster=speaker_id,        # one label per document
)
```

This composes with the method of composition: each posterior draw is clustered,
then the per-draw covariances are Rubin-pooled.

## Keep predictions in bounds: GLM links

Topic proportions live in `[0, 1]`, but OLS on θ can predict values outside that
range. For a bounded model, use a fractional-logit link (Papke & Wooldridge),
fit by quasi-likelihood with robust standard errors:

```python
effects = stm.estimate_effect(draws, X, feature_names=names, link="logit")
# link="log" gives a quasi-Poisson alternative.
```

## Report effects as a table

```python
import pandas as pd
rows = []
for e in effects:
    d = e.as_dict()
    for feat in e.feature_names:
        rows.append({"topic": d["topic"], "term": feat,
                     "estimate": d[feat]["coef"], "se": d[feat]["se"],
                     "z": d[feat]["z"]})
table = pd.DataFrame(rows)
```

Report point estimates, (clustered) standard errors, and confidence intervals,
and say plainly which effects clear conventional thresholds and which don't.
