# 5. Report and make reproducible

The last step is writing it up so a reader can evaluate your analysis and a
replicator can rerun it.

## Methods section

A complete methods section covers the corpus, the preprocessing, the model and
`K`, the covariate specification, and the validation. A template:

> We used [LDA / STM / …] to identify latent topics in a corpus of **N**
> documents drawn from [population], covering [time span]. The unit of analysis
> is the [article / paragraph / speech]; long documents were segmented into
> chunks of ≤ **W** words. After preprocessing (lowercasing, removing
> punctuation and a [SMART + custom] stopword list, pruning terms in fewer than
> **a** documents or more than **b**% of documents, and detecting collocations),
> the vocabulary contained **M** terms and **T** tokens.
>
> We estimated models with **K = [value]** topics. [Rationale: theory + a
> `searchK` scan over K ∈ {…}, balancing semantic coherence, exclusivity, and
> interpretability; results were robust to K ∈ {…}.] For the STM, topic
> prevalence was modeled as a function of [covariates]. We fixed the random seed
> (**seed = …**) for reproducibility.
>
> We validated the topics with word- and document-intrusion tests
> ([accuracy / agreement]), per-topic coherence and exclusivity, and bootstrap
> stability across **B** resamples; [k] topics flagged as unstable are
> interpreted cautiously. Software: topica [version].

## Results section

- A **topic table**: each topic's label, its top **probability** and **FREX**
  words, and its overall prevalence.
- **Covariate effects** with (clustered) standard errors and intervals.
- **Representative quotes** for the topics you interpret: close reading, not
  just word lists.

```python
import pandas as pd
import topica as tt

labels = tt.label_topics(model.topic_word, model.vocabulary, n=7)
prevalence = model.doc_topic.mean(axis=0)
table = pd.DataFrame({
    "topic": range(model.num_topics),
    "prevalence": prevalence,
    "top_words_frex": [", ".join(w for w, _ in labels[t]["frex"])
                       for t in range(model.num_topics)],
})
table.to_csv("topic_table.csv", index=False)
```

## Supplementary materials

Put in the appendix / replication archive:

- The **full topic–word distributions** and the **document–topic matrix**.
- **Robustness to K** (the headline result at neighboring `K`).
- **Preprocessing details** and the exact stopword list.
- **Validation results** (intrusion accuracy, coherence/exclusivity per topic,
  stability scores).

```python
import numpy as np
np.savetxt("phi.csv", model.topic_word, delimiter=",")   # topics × words
np.savetxt("theta.csv", model.doc_topic, delimiter=",")  # docs × topics
model.save("model.tt")                                    # full state, reloadable
```

## Make the pipeline reproducible

- **Fix every seed.** topica fits are bit-for-bit deterministic for a given
  `seed`, across machines and core counts. State the seeds you used.
- **Script the whole pipeline** end to end, from raw text → preprocessing → fit →
  tables/figures, so it runs from one command.
- **Pin versions.** Record the topica and NumPy versions
  (`topica.__version__`).
- **Share the model.** `model.save(path)` writes the complete fitted state;
  `Model.load(path)` brings it back, so reviewers can reproduce every number
  without refitting.

!!! success "You're done"
    A corpus you can defend, a `K` you can justify, topics you've validated,
    effects with honest uncertainty, and a pipeline anyone can rerun. That is a
    topic-modeling analysis a social-science journal can publish.

See the [worked examples](../examples/dubois.md) for this workflow applied end to
end on real data.
