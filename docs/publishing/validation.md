# 3. Validate the topics

This is the step that separates a publishable analysis from a fishing
expedition. You must show, with evidence, that your topics are (a) **coherent**
to humans, (b) **reproducible**, and (c) **interpretable** as substantive themes.

## Human validation: intrusion tests

The field-standard test (Chang et al. 2009, *Reading Tea Leaves*) asks whether a
human can tell a topic apart from noise. topica builds both variants for
you, with an answer key.

**Word intrusion**: each topic's top words plus one intruder from another topic.

```python
import topica

tests = topica.word_intrusion(model, n_words=5, seed=0)
for t in tests:
    print(f"Topic {t['topic']}: {t['words']}")
    # answer key for coding:
    # intruder '{t['intruder']}' at position {t['intruder_index']}
```

Show the shuffled `words` to coders (hide the key); a topic where coders reliably
spot the intruder is coherent.

**Document intrusion**: a topic's representative documents plus one where the
topic is nearly absent. This tests whether the topic captures real document
similarity.

```python
tests = topica.document_intrusion(model, texts=texts, n_docs=3, seed=0)
```

Report intrusion accuracy (and, ideally, inter-coder agreement) in your
supplementary materials.

## Computational validation: coherence and exclusivity

Per-topic metrics complement the human tests. Report both together: a good
topic is coherent **and** exclusive.

```python
coherence   = model.coherence(10)               # UMass, per topic
cv          = topica.coherence(model, texts, coherence_type="c_v", topn=10)
exclusivity = topica.exclusivity(model, 10)          # per topic

frontier = topica.quality_frontier(model, n=10)      # tidy: coherence, exclusivity, prevalence
```

`c_v` correlates best with human judgement; UMass is a fast intrinsic check;
NPMI is the normalized middle ground. The coherence×exclusivity scatter is the
canonical STM quality plot: weak topics sit in the lower-left.

## Stability: answer the "fishing expedition" critique head-on

A topic that dissolves when you perturb the corpus is not a finding. Refit on
bootstrap resamples and report which topics are robust:

```python
boot = topica.bootstrap_stability(docs, k=20, n_boot=50, iterations=800)
for t, s in zip(boot["topic"], boot["stability"]):
    print(f"Topic {t}: stability {s:.2f}")     # mean top-word Jaccard across resamples
print("overall:", boot["mean"])
```

Also check that the *same* topics emerge across **random seeds**, aligning topics
between fits and scoring their overlap:

```python
a = topica.LDA(num_topics=20, seed=1); a.fit(docs, iterations=800)
b = topica.LDA(num_topics=20, seed=2); b.fit(docs, iterations=800)
pairs = topica.align_topics(a, b)                    # one-to-one matching (Hungarian)
print("stability across seeds:", topica.topic_stability([a, b], topn=10))
```

Flag fragile topics explicitly. A paper that says "topics 4 and 11 were unstable
across resamples and we interpret them cautiously" is *more* credible, not less.

## Interpretation: close reading, not just top words

Distant reading (top words) and **close reading** (the actual documents) are both
required. Pull a topic's most representative documents and read them, with the
topic's words highlighted in your notebook:

```python
labels = topica.label_topics(model.topic_word, model.vocabulary, n=8)  # prob & FREX
html = topica.find_thoughts_html(model, texts, n_docs=3, n_words=8)    # highlighted quotes
```

Use **FREX** (frequent *and* exclusive) words, not just the most probable ones,
when labeling. They are far more evocative of what makes a topic distinctive.

!!! danger "What topics are NOT"
    Topics are statistical patterns of word co-occurrence. They are **not**
    necessarily coherent concepts, and **not** necessarily what a document is
    "about." Write *"this document has high probability for Topic 3"* and *"words
    associated with Topic 3 suggest…"* Never write *"the model discovered that…"* or
    *"this document is about Topic 3."*

## Common problems and what to do

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Junk topics** (stopwords, numbers) | Under-pruned vocabulary | Add custom stopwords; raise `min_doc_freq`; `rm_top` |
| **Duplicate topics** | `K` too high, or duplicate documents | Lower `K`; dedupe; check `align_topics` / `topic_correlation` |
| **Uninterpretable topics** | Not every topic is meaningful | Document as "Mixed/Other"; consider lower `K` |
| **One dominant topic** | Corpus-wide vocabulary | May be legitimate; or treat as a background topic and `rm_top` |
