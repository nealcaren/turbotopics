# LLM embeddings and labels: Du Bois's *Crisis* essays

This worked example runs the **embedding-native** path end to end with the
[`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/) library doing the two jobs that touch a model:
generating the document embeddings and naming the topics. Everything between is
pure topica. The corpus is the 704 essays W. E. B. Du Bois wrote for *The Crisis*
between 1910 and 1934 (the same corpus as the [Du Bois example](dubois.md), here
modeled from sentence embeddings rather than word counts).

!!! info "Focus of this example"
    `llm_embed` (cached) · an embedding model (`FASTopic`) · `llm_topic_labels` ·
    `plot_report`. For the count-based workflow on this corpus see
    [Du Bois](dubois.md).

    `pip install "topica[llm,viz]"` covers `llm` (OpenAI built in) and the ollama
    plugin. The local `sentence-transformers` embedder below additionally needs
    `pip install llm-sentence-transformers`; for a fully local, torch-free run use
    ollama embeddings (`all-minilm`) instead. Reproducible with
    [`examples/llm_topics.py`](https://github.com/nealcaren/topica/blob/main/examples/llm_topics.py).

## 1. Corpus

```python
import csv, topica

rows = list(csv.DictReader(open("examples/dubois_crisis.csv")))
texts = [r["text"] for r in rows]                       # raw essay text for embedding
decade = [f"{r['decade']}s" for r in rows]              # 1910s / 1920s / 1930s
stop = open("examples/english-stoplist.txt").read().split()
docs = [topica.tokenize(t, stopwords=stop, min_length=4) for t in texts]   # tokens for the model
```

## 2. Embed — once, cached

`llm_embed` produces the document-vector matrix the embedding models need. Naming
a local `sentence-transformers` model keeps it offline and free; `cache=` writes
the matrix to disk so re-running the script reloads it instead of re-embedding
(embeddings are the costly step).

```python
doc_emb = topica.llm_embed(
    texts, model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", cache="crisis_emb.npz"
)
doc_emb.shape          # (704, 384)
```

## 3. Model

`FASTopic` reads topics off optimal-transport plans between the document, topic,
and word embeddings — mixed-membership, so every essay gets a topic distribution.

```python
model = topica.FASTopic(num_topics=10, epochs=200, seed=1)
model.fit(docs, doc_emb)

for t in range(model.num_topics):
    print(t, " ".join(w for w, _ in model.top_words(6, topic=t)))
```

## 4. Name the topics with an LLM

topica is the plumbing: it builds a prompt from each topic's top words and
representative essays, and you bring the model. `temperature=0` keeps the labels
stable, and `set_labels=True` stores them so they flow into `topic_info` and the
report.

```python
backend = topica.llm_backend("gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
labels = topica.llm_topic_labels(model, texts, call=backend, set_labels=True)

for t, label in enumerate(labels):
    print(t, label)

topica.topic_label_prompts(model, texts)[1]   # inspect exactly what the model saw
```

```
0 social class and prejudice
1 Colonialism and Global Revolution
2 lynching and racial violence
3 Divine Drama and Kingdoms
4 economic empowerment initiatives
5 African American Church History
6 Civil unrest and military presence
7 Early 20th Century Politics
8 Race and Global Conflict
9 voter segregation and rights
```

The key is resolved by `llm`: by default the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
(or a stored `llm keys` value), or pass `llm_backend(..., key=...)` to hand one in.
A local model works the same way — `llm_backend("llama3.2", ...)` with the
`llm-ollama` plugin needs no key at all. The deterministic descriptors
(`label_topics`: FREX / probability / lift) remain the defensible naming for
publication; the LLM labels are the readable shorthand. With `set_labels=True` they
replace the default labels everywhere, including the report below.

## 5. Report

```python
fig = topica.plot_report(model, texts=docs, timestamps=decade, n=6,
                         title="FASTopic on W.E.B. Du Bois's Crisis essays")
fig.savefig("crisis_report.png", dpi=200)
```

![A plot_report figure for the Du Bois Crisis essays: topic prevalence labelled by
gpt-4o-mini, the coherence-vs-exclusivity quality plot, the topic correlation
heatmap, and topic shares across the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s.](../images/llm_workflow_report.png)

This figure is real output of the whole pipeline above — MiniLM embeddings, the
FASTopic fit, and the `gpt-4o-mini` labels from step 4 (the labels appear because
`set_labels=True` stored them). The time panel reads as intellectual history:
*Colonialism and Global Revolution* and *economic empowerment initiatives* climb
steadily from the 1910s to the 1930s, tracking the arc of Du Bois's later writing.
