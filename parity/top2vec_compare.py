"""Cross-implementation check for topica's Top2Vec against BERTopic.

topica's Top2Vec and BERTopic are independent embedding-clustering topic models.
They share the same shape (reduce the document embeddings, density-cluster, read
topics off the clusters) but not the same reducer: topica uses randomized PCA,
BERTopic uses UMAP. Exact agreement is therefore impossible, so we hold them to a
statistical-equivalence bar on a controlled task.

We plant well-separated document clusters (each with its own vocabulary block),
hand BOTH models the SAME document embeddings, and ask how well each recovers the
planted structure. The bar, following the keyATM parity test, is that topica
recovers the ground truth at least as well as BERTopic does (within a margin),
and that the two implementations agree with each other. We also report top-word
purity: each topic's top c-TF-IDF words should come from a single planted block.

Skips cleanly when BERTopic (and its UMAP/HDBSCAN deps) is unavailable.
