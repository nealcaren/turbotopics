"""Cross-implementation validation: topica's STS vs the authors' reference R
implementation of the Structural Topic and Sentiment-Discourse model (Chen &
Mankad 2024, *Management Science*).

Both are the same model -- Laplace variational EM over the 2K-1 prevalence +
sentiment-discourse latent, with the topic-word distribution modulated by a
continuous per-document sentiment. They are independent implementations, so
validation is statistical: fit both on the SAME tokenized corpus and ask whether
they recover the same topics.

This uses the authors' published *political-blog* fit (``Poliblogs_results.RDS``,
K=5) from their replication package -- the same corpus the rest of the paper's
worked example runs on. R regenerates the exact corpus (``textProcessor`` +
``prepDocuments(lower.thresh = 30)`` on ``Data/poliblogs2008.csv``), reads the
fitted RDS, and also fits R ``stm`` on the same corpus as a calibration baseline.
topica then fits both STS and STM and we align everything.

The representative topic-word is read at the **mean** sentiment, not at neutral
(sentiment = 0). STS parks topic signal in the sentiment direction kappa^(s) when
the sentiment seed correlates with content, so the topic a reader recognizes is
softmax(m_v + kappa^(t)_k + kappa^(s)_k * mean_d alpha^(s)_{d,k}), the "Avg alpha"
view the reference's ``print.topWords`` reports. (Read at neutral, the two engines
agree far less, because each splits the content/sentiment decomposition its own
way; read at the mean, they recover the same topics.)

The check is benchmarked against the STM baseline rather than an absolute
threshold: topica-STS should sit about as close to R-STS as topica's already
validated STM sits to R-STM, and STS should agree with topica's own STM
(confirming STS extends STM). On this well-conditioned corpus all three land in
the mid-0.90s. topica fits with its ``"lasso"`` kappa estimator (the default is
``"ridge"``) to match the reference's glmnet estimator.

Point the script at the replication package via ``STS_REPL_DIR`` (default
``~/Downloads/mnsc.2022.00261``). Skips (exit 0) if Rscript, the ``stm`` package,
or the replication results are unavailable. Run directly:
