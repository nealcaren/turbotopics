`topica` is a fast topic-modeling library for Python with more than a dozen models, built for social scientists who want to move from text data to publishable results in a single workflow. It brings together models and tools usually split across JVM software like MALLET and R packages like `stm`, and runs them on a parallel Rust core competitive with the standard implementations, with reproducible fits: the variational models are identical to the bit, and the samplers reproduce from a fixed seed and thread count. Each model comes with the validation, covariate-effect, and reporting tools to meet the standards reviewers expect.

```bash
pip install topica
```

The core needs only NumPy. Optional extras add features without weighing the core
down: `topica[viz]` (matplotlib plots), `topica[formula]` (R-style formulas),
`topica[polars]` (Polars frames), and `topica[llm]` (LLM labels and embeddings,
OpenAI or local via ollama). PyTorch is never required.

```python
from topica import LDA

model = LDA(num_topics=2, seed=42)
model.fit([["cat", "dog", "fish"]] * 15 + [["planet", "star", "moon"]] * 15, iters=1000)

for i, words in enumerate(model.top_words(3)):
    print(f"Topic {i}:", " ".join(w for w, _ in words))
```

See the [getting-started guide](https://nealcaren.github.io/topica/getting-started/quickstart/) and the [worked examples](https://nealcaren.github.io/topica/examples/dubois/) for end-to-end analyses.

## Models

**Count-based models** learn topics from word counts (collapsed Gibbs, variational EM, or an amortized VAE):

| Model | What it's for |
|-------|---------------|
| **`LDA`** | Classic topics via fast collapsed-Gibbs (SparseLDA); optional multi-threaded and LightLDA alias samplers |
| **`STM`** | The Structural Topic Model: correlated topics with prevalence **and** content covariates |
| **`STS`** | Structural Topic **and Sentiment-Discourse**: covariate-driven topic sentiment/tone on top of STM |
| **`CTM`** | Correlated topics (logistic-normal) |
| **`DMR`** | Topics conditioned on document metadata (Dirichlet-multinomial regression) |
| **`DTM`** | Dynamic topics that evolve across time slices |
| **`HDP`** | Nonparametric LDA that *infers* the number of topics |
| **`keyATM` / `seededlda`** | Guided topics steered by seed words |
| **`ProdLDA`** | Sharper, more coherent topics via a product-of-experts word model, fit as an amortized VAE (no PyTorch) |
| **`PT` / `GSDMM`** | Short-text models for tweets, survey answers, headlines |
| **`SupervisedLDA`** | Topics shaped to predict a per-document response |
| **`LabeledLDA`** | Supervised topics tied to document labels |
| **`SAGE`** | Content-covariate topics: the same topic worded differently across groups |
| **`PA` / `HLDA`** | Topic hierarchies (Pachinko, nested-CRP) |

**Embedding-based models** start from document embeddings you supply (no PyTorch, no UMAP/numba in the wheel):

| Model | What it's for |
|-------|---------------|
| **`BERTopic`** | Cluster document embeddings, label topics by class-TF-IDF; topic reduction and a soft per-document distribution |
| **`Top2Vec`** | Topics as points in the embedding space; topic words are the nearest word vectors |
| **`ETM`** | Generative LDA with the topic-word distribution factored through embeddings (`β = softmax(ρ·α)`); per-document EM or an amortized VAE (`inference="vae"`) |
| **`FASTopic`** | Topics read off two optimal-transport plans between document, topic, and word embeddings |

Every model exposes the same shape: `fit(docs, …)`, then `topic_word` (φ), `doc_topic` (θ), `top_words(n)`, and `save`/`load`. The count-based variational models (`CTM`/`STM`/`STS`/`SupervisedLDA`/`DTM`) parallelize across cores while staying bit-for-bit deterministic. The embedding models split into two kinds: `BERTopic` and `Top2Vec` run the `reduce → cluster → represent` pipeline, while `ETM` and `FASTopic` are generative and mixed-membership; all of them take vectors from any embedder (sentence-transformers, an API, a local model such as ollama).

## Diagnostics & analysis

Model-agnostic: they work on any fitted model's `topic_word`/`doc_topic`:

- **Quality:** `coherence` (`u_mass`, `c_v`, `c_uci`, `c_npmi`; computed in the Rust core), `exclusivity`, `topic_diversity`, `quality_frontier`
- **Labeling:** `label_topics` (prob / FREX / lift / score), `frex`, `relevance`, `find_thoughts`, `topic_table`, `summary`
- **Validation:** `word_intrusion`, `document_intrusion`, `bootstrap_stability`, `search_k`
- **Reliability:** `select_model` (fit many seeds) and `ensemble` (combine runs into a consensus more reliable than any single fit — cluster/align/stable methods, the last a gensim `EnsembleLda` port)
- **Comparison:** `fighting_words` (weighted log-odds) for contrasting corpora
- **Covariate effects:** `estimate_effect` (method of composition, **cluster-robust SEs**, GLM links), `topic_correlation`, and the design helpers `one_hot` (top level) plus `stm.spline` / `stm.interaction` (an `stm`-style API); `posterior_theta_samples` draws θ for the logistic-normal models (STM/CTM)
- **Preprocessing:** `tokenize`, `learn_phrases` / `apply_phrases`, `split_documents`, the `Corpus` class

## Performance

topica runs on a parallel Rust core. It is several times faster than R `stm` — the single-threaded field standard — for the structural and other variational models, and it matches the hand-tuned compiled samplers core for core: parity with Java MALLET on plain LDA and with the C++ `keyATM` on keyword models. On the political-blog corpus (2,000 documents, fit time only, same iterations on both sides):

| Model | Reference | topica speedup |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| STM | R `stm` | **3–6× single-threaded, ~10–22× multithreaded** |
| LDA | Java MALLET | parity single-threaded; multithread speedup **grows with corpus size** |
| keyATM | R `keyATM` | parity single-threaded, **~2×** multithreaded |

For the approximate parallel Gibbs samplers the multithreaded speedup **grows with corpus size**: the per-sweep count-table merge is fixed overhead, so larger corpora amortize it over more sampling work. LDA's eight-core speedup over MALLET runs about 3× at 2,000 documents and reaches ~4× at 5,000, so the small-corpus figures above understate what large-corpus users see.

Every fit is reproducible from a fixed seed and validated against its reference. See [Benchmarks](https://nealcaren.github.io/topica/benchmarks/) for the full methodology; reproduce the 2,000-document table with `python benchmarks/speed_vs_r.py` and the size-varying curve with `python benchmarks/speed_vs_size.py`.
