"""Naming-convention lint: the shared vocabulary, enforced.

A hand-maintained style guide drifts. This test is the source of truth for
topica's cross-model API vocabulary; ``docs/contributing/conventions.md`` is the
explanation. It introspects every model's ``__init__`` and ``fit`` signature and
fails when a new model breaks a convention, so conceptual integrity is checked by
CI rather than by memory.

Principled exceptions and tracked drift are recorded below (mirroring
``conformance.py``): EXCEPT sets are structural and permanent; KNOWN_DRIFT is the
burn-down worklist of things we intend to align later, kept here so the suite is
green today while still documenting what is not yet conformant.
