"""Statistical-equivalence check for topica's Top2Vec against BERTopic.

topica (randomized-PCA reducer) and BERTopic (UMAP reducer) are independent
embedding-clustering topic models, so we do not expect identical topics. On a
controlled planted-cluster task with shared document embeddings, we require that
topica recovers the ground truth at least as well as BERTopic does (within a
margin) and that the two agree with each other. Skips cleanly when BERTopic and
its UMAP/HDBSCAN dependencies are unavailable.
