"""CI guard: the _topica.pyi stub must not drift from the compiled extension.

For every class exported by topica._topica this test asserts:
  - no public (non-dunder) member on the compiled class is absent from the stub,
  - no stub member is absent from the compiled class.

Member-level names only (not full signature equality, which is too brittle for
PyO3 extension types). This is the guard that would have caught the drift fixed
in issue #108.
