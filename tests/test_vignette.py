"""End-to-end regression test: the STM vignette workflow on the gadarian data.

Guards the full pipeline — preprocess -> STM(prevalence) -> estimate_effect —
and the substantive finding it reproduces: the experimental `treatment`
significantly shifts topic prevalence (Gadarian & Albertson 2014). Skips if the
vendored dataset is absent.
